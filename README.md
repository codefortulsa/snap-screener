The SNAP Screener is a single-page web application built with React and hosted on Firebase Hosting. Currently avaiable at [snap-screener-ok.firebaseapp.com](https://snap-screener-ok.web.app/) with final domain forthcoming. School contacts are managed with a [Google Sheet available here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1V1vWm9HNuiVOnXYAXoXW5f6KmsoAKjA3En_GYl93kYk/edit?usp=sharing). All other pertinent settings are available within `src/lib/config.js`â€”such as who recieves all email notifications with the variable `NOTIFY_CC`.

**PLEASE NOTE**: The spreadsheet uses real email addresses so submitting a form will, in fact, send emails out to all contacts listed for the selected school.
